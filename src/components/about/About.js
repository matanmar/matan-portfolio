            <p>
              I am looking for a challenging job to start my career as a
              front-end developer. I have recently graduated a Full-Stack
              JavaScript course. Currently, I am investing my time on a few
              projects which use mainly React.js, HTML, and CSS in order to gain
              more experience and improve my front-end skills. I decided to
              deeply study the front-end side because I enjoy seeing, in a
              tangible way, the work that I do come to life. I have a sense of
              humor which creates a good atmosphere at work, love to work as
              part of a team, and like to learn from othersâ€™ experiences and
              share my knowledge. I pay attention to details and care about my
              workplace. I am a dedicated worker and am always curious to learn
              new things.
